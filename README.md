## Objectives

Create an app that lets you manage your playlists on Spotify. I'm working on this project trying to achieve the following functionlaities:

* `Search and add` multiple songs to multiple playlists by text or txt file.
* `Move songs` between playlists.
* `Delete songs` of multiple playlists at the same time.
* `Game` A simple game of guessing the songs of your playlists by an extract of 30 seconds.
